## 🎯 What is Rank Rushd?

Rank Rushd is a fun, addictive game that puts your movie knowledge to the test! Think of it like Google's "Higher or Lower" game, but with **Letterboxd scores** instead of search terms.

### 🎪 How to Play

1. **Look at the movie on the left** - you can see its Letterboxd rating, director, actors, and how many people have watched it
2. **Guess if the movie on the right has a higher or lower Letterboxd score**
3. **Tap "Higher" or "Lower"** to make your guess
4. **Build your streak** - the longer you go without making a mistake, the higher your score!

### 🎨 Game Features

- **🎭 Three difficulty levels:**
  - **Casual** - 250 popular movies
  - **Average** - 500 movies 
  - **Cinephile** - 1000 movies (for the true film buffs!)

- **💡 Hints system:**
  - Reveal director, main actors, and viewer count
  - Choose from 1, 3, 5, or infinite hints

- **❤️ Lives system:**
  - Play with 1, 3, or 5 lives
  - More lives = more chances to build that perfect streak!

- **🏆 Score tracking:**
  - Beat your personal best
  - Compete with friends for the highest streak

### 🎬 Perfect for Movie Lovers

Whether you're a casual movie watcher or a hardcore cinephile, Rank Rushd will test your knowledge of film ratings and maybe even introduce you to some new movies to add to your watchlist!
